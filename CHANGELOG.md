## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Read every mainstream application protocol — AP203, AP214, and AP242, legacy
  included — and write modern AP242 edition 2 (IS).
- Navigate what you read with `model.scene()` — lightweight handles over b-rep
  geometry, the assembly tree, display meshes, PMI, product metadata,
  presentation, and units.
- Author what you write with `StepBuilder`, which builds files the way kernels
  hold data; `Ap242Author` is the strict low-level layer beneath it.
- Heal non-standard input — what can be fixed is normalized, what cannot is
  dropped with a reason in a provenance `Report`, never silently.
- Run on one lean universal schema model instead of per-schema code, with
  entities that never appear in real STEP files pruned out. The generated
  coverage matrix ([`docs/entities.md`](docs/entities.md)) lists exactly what is
  read and written.
